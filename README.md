# Overview

A layer that allows Juju Charms to interact with a remote machine over SSH.

# Usage

In `layers.yaml`:
```yaml
includes: ['layer:management-ssh'] 
```

## Known Limitations and Issues

This not only helps users but gives people a place to start if they want to help
you add features to your charm.

# Configuration

The configuration options will be listed on the charm store, however If you're
making assumptions or opinionated decisions in the charm (like setting a default
administrator password), you should detail that here so the user knows how to
change it immediately, etc.

# Contact Information

Though this will be listed in the charm store itself don't assume a user will
know that, so include that information here:
